# RandomEQ1
My first audio plugin â€” a basic peak filter that tests your ears by encouraging you to choose what you think the parameters are.

The source includes some useful algorithms, such as a biquad filter (with shelf/peak implementations);
a modified Lehmer random number generator; and a sqrt approximation.

The device is simple, but can certainly be used to train your ears!
