# RandomEQ
My first audio plugin, made for a Uni project â€” a basic peak filter that tests your ears by encouraging you to choose what you think the parameters are.
Currently only working on MacOS.

The source includes some useful algorithms, such as a biquad filter (with shelf/peak implementations);
a modified Lehmer random number generator; and a sqrt approximation.

The device is simple, but can certainly be used to train your ears!
