# RandomEQ
My first audio plugin made for a Uni project â€” a random peak filter that tests your listening skills by encouraging you to choose what you think the parameters are.

Currently only working on MacOS.

//////////

The source includes some useful algorithms, such as a biquad filter (with shelf/peak implementations);
a modified Lehmer random number generator; and some sqrt approximations.
