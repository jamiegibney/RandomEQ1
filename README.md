# RandomEQ
My first audio plugin made for a Uni project â€” a random peak filter that tests your listening skills by encouraging you to guess its parameters.

Currently only working on MacOS as a VST3.

The source includes some useful algorithms, such as a biquad filter (with shelf/peak implementations);
a modified Lehmer random number generator; and some sqrt approximations.
